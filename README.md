# Spark Visa Processing Project

## Overview

The Spark Visa Processing Project is designed to analyze and visualize visa issuance data in Japan. By leveraging Apache Spark for data processing and Docker for containerization, this project aims to provide insights into the trends of visa issuance over several years, categorized by country and continent.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Process and clean visa issuance data from various countries to Japan.
- Analyze the data to uncover patterns and trends in visa applications.
- Visualize the results to facilitate better understanding and decision-making regarding international travel and immigration policies.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to achieve its goals, including:
- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization, employing libraries such as Matplotlib and Pandas.
- **Azure Virtual Machine**: Hosting the Docker containers, providing the necessary computational resources for the Spark cluster.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components:
- **Docker Setup**: A Docker Compose configuration that defines the Spark master and worker nodes, facilitating scalable data processing.
- **Data Processing Scripts**: Python scripts that handle data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Visualization Outputs**: Graphical representations of the processed data, illustrating visa issuance trends over time.

## Visualizations

The project features several key visualizations:
- **Visa Issuance by Continent**: A bar chart showing the distribution of visas issued by continent from 2006 to 2017.
- **Top 10 Countries with Most Issued Visas in 2017**: A bar chart highlighting the countries with the highest visa issuance in 2017.
- **Yearly Visa Issued by Countries**: A choropleth map visualizing the distribution of visas issued across different countries over the years.

These visualizations help to identify trends and patterns in visa issuance, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in the accompanying documentation to build and deploy the Docker containers. 

Once the environment is running, users can access the Spark web interface to monitor the processing tasks and view the results of the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of Apache Spark in processing large datasets efficiently and the flexibility of Docker in managing application environments. By visualizing visa issuance data, the project contributes to a better understanding of international travel trends to Japan.
